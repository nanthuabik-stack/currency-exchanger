This is a simple and functional web application built with Flask that allows users to convert currency amounts between different international currencies (USD, INR, EUR, GBP). The app integrates with a live Exchange Rate API to fetch real-time conversion rates. All conversions are saved in a local SQLite database, allowing for potential future features like conversion history tracking.
